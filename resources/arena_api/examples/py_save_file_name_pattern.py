Save: File Name Pattern
	This example demonstrates saving a set of images according to a file name
	pattern, which uses the <count> and <timestamp> tags to differentiate between
	saved images. The essential points of the example include setting the image
	writer up with a file name pattern and using the cascading I/O operator (<<)
	to update the timestamp and save each image.

	File name pattern
		File name patterns can use tags to easily customize your file names.
		Customizable tags can be added to a file name pattern and later set on
		the fly. Two tags, <count> and <datetime> have been built in to the save
		library. As seen below, <datetime> can take an argument to specify
		output. <count> also accepts arguments (local, path, and global) to
		specify what exactly is being counted.
